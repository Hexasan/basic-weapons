# About ü§∫

![Divider](https://github.com/Khazoda/basic-weapons/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/showcase.png?raw=true)
Basic Weapons adds **5** new weapon types of every vanilla tool material _(Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite)_ to complement the existing sword and axe in Minecraft. Each weapon is balanced around damage, attack speed, crafting costs and special effects. _If you have Better Combat installed, the weapons are also balanced around attack reach, number of enemies hit, and combos._

#### Weapons should feel _unique, powerful, easy to use_ and _fair._ Please take a look at this high level overview of each weapon:

| Weapon        | Damage | Speed  | Baseline Effect      |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | -------------------- |
| Vanilla Sword | Medium | Medium | Sweeping             |
| Vanilla Axe   | High   | Slow   | Shield Break         |
| Dagger        | Low    | Fast   |                      |
| Hammer        | High   | Slow   | Knock target upwards |
| Quarterstaff  | Low    | Medium |                      |
| Spear         | Medium | Medium |                      |
| Club          | High   | Slow   | Slow target          |

# Better Combat Integration¬†üî•

Basic Weapons works well as a drop-in mod to spice up the weapon variety in your adventures, but it plays especially well when paired with [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat). Each weapon has a unique playstyle,

With Better Combat installed, spears gain more weapon range, quarterstaves receive exciting new attack combos, daggers and clubs can be paired with other weapons for dual-wielding mayhem, and the hammer even features a fully custom attack animation.

If any of this sounds interesting to you, I recommend you try the two mods out together. [Better Combat](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-combat) can take some getting used to at first, but it's well worth your time investment in the long term, bringing a new layer of strategy and fun to your weapon choices and fights.
